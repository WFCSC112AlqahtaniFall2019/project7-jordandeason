I chose a dataset about WNBA Player stats from the 2016-2017 season. The set contains the total amounts of player stats like assists, double doubles, blocks, steals, and many more. I chose this data set because I played basketball my whole life and have been to many WNBA games. The statistics I chose to look at were assists, steals, points, and minutes played.
